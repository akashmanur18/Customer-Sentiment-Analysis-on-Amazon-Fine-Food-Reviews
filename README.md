## ⚙️ Prerequisites

### Python Version
- Python 3.8+

### Required Libraries

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn mysql-connector-python wordcloud plotly
```

| Library | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pandas` | Data manipulation |
| `numpy` | Numerical operations |
| `matplotlib` | Plotting |
| `seaborn` | Statistical visualizations |
| `scikit-learn` | Machine learning models |
| `mysql-connector-python` | MySQL database connection |

## 🗄️ Database Setup

The script connects to a **local MySQL database**. Make sure you have:

1. MySQL Server running locally
2. A database named `amazon_database`
3. A table named `reviews` containing the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset

Update the credentials in `code.py` if needed:

```python
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    passwd="your_password",      # ← update this
    database="amazon_database"
)
```

> ⚠️ **Security Note:** Avoid hardcoding credentials. Use environment variables or a `.env` file for production use.

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
cd Project_2
python code.py
```

The script will run all 10 pipeline sections automatically and print progress to the console.

## 🔬 Pipeline Sections

### 1. 📥 Data Loading
- Connects to MySQL and loads all reviews into a Pandas DataFrame.

### 2. 🔍 Initial Data Exploration
- Displays shape, data types, summary statistics, and missing value analysis.

### 3. 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Fills missing `ProfileName` and `Summary` values.
- Removes duplicate reviews based on `UserId`, `ProductId`, and `Time`.
- Identifies categorical and numerical columns.

### 4. 🔧 Data Cleaning
- Converts `Time` column from date strings to `datetime` objects.
- Detects and caps outliers in `HelpfulnessNumerator` and `HelpfulnessDenominator` using the IQR method.
- Removes rows with invalid `Score` values (outside 1–5 range).
- Removes rows where `HelpfulnessNumerator > HelpfulnessDenominator`.

### 5. 🏗️ Feature Engineering
| New Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| `Sentiment` | Positive (Score > 3), Neutral (Score = 3), Negative (Score < 3) |
| `ReviewLength` | Character count of the review text |
| `HelpfulnessRatio` | `HelpfulnessNumerator / HelpfulnessDenominator` |
| `ReviewYear` | Extracted year from `Time` |
| `ReviewMonth` | Extracted month from `Time` |
| `ReviewDay` | Extracted day from `Time` |
| `ReviewDayOfWeek` | Day of week (0=Monday, 6=Sunday) |

### 6. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (15 Visualizations)
All charts are saved to `EDA_Visualizations.pdf`:

1. Score Distribution
2. Sentiment Distribution
3. Correlation Heatmap
4. Review Length Distribution
5. Helpfulness Ratio Distribution
6. Boxplot — Review Length vs Score
7. Violin Plot — Helpfulness Ratio vs Sentiment
8. Pairplot of Key Features
9. Reviews Per Year (Line Chart)
10. Reviews by Month (Bar Chart)
11. Scatter — Helpfulness vs Review Length
12. Top 10 Most Reviewed Products
13. Average Score Trend Over Years
14. Word Cloud of Review Text *(requires `wordcloud`)*
15. Sunburst Chart — Sentiment by Year *(requires `plotly`)*

### 7. 🤖 Machine Learning Models

#### A. Supervised Learning — Sentiment Classification
- **Features used:** `HelpfulnessRatio`, `ReviewLength`, `Score`
- **Train/Test Split:** 80/20 with stratification
- **Scaling:** StandardScaler

| Model | Accuracy |
|---|---|
| Random Forest Classifier | 100% |
| Gradient Boosting Classifier | 100% |

#### B. Unsupervised Learning — Clustering
- **K-Means Clustering** — 3 clusters (positive, neutral, negative)
- **PCA** — Reduced to 2 components for visualization
  - PC1 explains ~38.6% variance
  - PC2 explains ~33.3% variance

### 8. 💾 Output Files
- `Amazon_Fine_Food_Reviews_Cleaned.csv` — Fully cleaned and feature-engineered dataset
- `EDA_Visualizations.pdf` — All EDA and ML visualizations

## 📝 Notes

- The ML models achieve 100% accuracy because `Score` is used as a direct feature, and `Sentiment` is derived entirely from `Score`. This is intentional for demonstrating pipeline structure. In real-world NLP applications, `Text` would be vectorized (e.g., TF-IDF, BERT) instead.
- Word Cloud and Plotly Sunburst are optional and will be skipped gracefully if libraries are not installed.
- The script samples **50,000 rows** for ML model training to ensure reasonable runtime.
